## Description
Our team considered the challenges that Coronavirus has presented and the new normal many of us are facing -- spending more time at home, more 'free time' on our hands, a wealth of entertainment options to pass that time.

What better way to pass this time, than by diving into a Book? As Nora Ephron says:
>Reading is escape, and the opposite of escape; it’s a way to make contact with reality after a day of making things up, and it’s a way of making contact with someone else’s imagination after a day that’s all too real.
